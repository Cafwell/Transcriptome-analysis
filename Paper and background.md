# T.congolense
Animal trypanosomiasis, also known as **nagana** and **nagana pest**, or **sleeping sickness**, is mainly caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense.

This parasite is spread by tsetse flies:

Trypanosoma congolense only lives in blood vessels, and causes in particular anaemia

## Lifecycle
+ The bloodstream stage that proliferate in the blood of infected mammalian host are ingested by the insect (tsetse fly) during the blood meal.   
+ They differentiate into procyclic stage in the mid-gut and migrate to the salivary glands and proboscis where they attach as epimastigotes stage.
+ They then differentiate into infective metacyclic stage that are transmitted to a new mammalian host during the next blood meal. See Fig below:

# Terms
## ESTs
Expressed sequence tag (EST): a randomly selected cDNA clone, the 5'-and 3'-terminal single sequencing was performed to pick out the short cDNA sequences. It is expensive and time-consuming to whole genome sequencing genes because only 2% of the genome sequence encodes a protein, so you can construct a cDNA library of the mRNA that actually encodes the protein, sequence the cDNA, and get the EST sequence to discover new genes.

## VSG
Variant surface glycoproteins, which enables parasites to evade adaptive immunity through antigen variation.

## Oxidative phosphorylation
It refers to the reaction that accompanies ATP production in biological oxidation
