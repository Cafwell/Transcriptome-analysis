# Abstract and Introduction
## T.congolense
Animal trypanosomiasis, also known as **nagana** and **nagana pest**, or **sleeping sickness**, is mainly caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense.

This parasite is spread by tsetse flies:

Trypanosoma congolense only lives in blood vessels, and causes in particular anaemia

### Lifecycle
+ The _**Bloodstream stage**_ that proliferate in the blood of infected mammalian host are ingested by the insect (tsetse fly) during the blood meal.   
+ They differentiate into _**Procyclic stage_** in the mid-gut and migrate to the salivary glands and proboscis where they attach as _**Epimastigotes stage_**.
+ They then differentiate into infective _**Metacyclic stage_** that are transmitted to a new mammalian host during the next blood meal. See Fig below:

## Library
ESTs of VSG:
+ Bloodstream: 26 EST clusters
  + 6 of them shared by Metacyclic libary
+ Metacyclic: 13 EST clusters
+ Epimastigote: Rare
+ Procyclic: None

Enzymes:

> ESTs encoding enzymes for _oxidative phosphorylation and aa metabolism_ - 

Procyclic and Epimastigote : Metacyclic and Bloodstream =   
2 : 1

> ESTs encoding enzymes involving _glycolysis, citric acid cycle and nucleotide metabolism_ -    

Four stages ratios ≈   
1 : 1 : 1 : 1

> Most abundant enzyme groups are -

Cysteine; Proteases; Kinases and Phosphatases

## From bloodstream to procyclic stage
Associated with 
1. morphological changes;
2. a switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation for energy metabolism;
3. the replacement of the VSG with procyclic-specific surface proteins.


# Methods
Use [BSF IL300 clone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014489491900644) and BALB/c mice culture.


# EST library and Sequencing

## Library construction
1. Isolate total RNA from PCF, EMF and MCF cells and from BSF cells obtained from mice 7 days after inoculation with the MCF cells. (TRIzolRegent kit)
2. Using polyATtract mRNA Isolation System isolate Poly(A)-containing mRNA
3. Prepare six EST libraries:
   * four from the mRNAs of each of the four cell types 
   * two additional normalized EST libraries from the MCF and BSF mRNAs

### Words
## ESTs
Expressed sequence tag (EST): a randomly selected cDNA clone, the 5'-and 3'-terminal single sequencing was performed to pick out the short cDNA sequences. It is expensive and time-consuming to whole genome sequencing genes because only 2% of the genome sequence encodes a protein, so you can construct a cDNA library of the mRNA that actually encodes the protein, sequence the cDNA, and get the EST sequence to discover new genes.

## VSG
Variant surface glycoproteins, which enables parasites to evade adaptive immunity through antigen variation.

## Oxidative phosphorylation
It refers to the reaction that accompanies ATP production in biological oxidation
