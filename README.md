Parasites
+ Causing various diseases. Ex: sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease.
+ Variety of hosts.

Want to:

1. Obtain the proteins sequences from the ESTs data of T. congolese
2. Have a pipeline of analysis of ESTs data they can use for future datasets.
3. For the protein sequences to be named in a human-readable formatting
4. To be able to retrieve a specific protein sequence from the results.
5. To understand the different outputs and how to use them.
