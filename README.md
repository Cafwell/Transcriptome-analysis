# Transcriptome-analysis

Working on Trypanosoma:
Taxon of protists -> Unicellular Eukaryotes.
Parasites
+ Causing various diseases. Ex: sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease.
+ Variety of hosts.

Want to:

1. Obtain the proteins sequences from the ESTs data of T.congolese
2. Have a pipeline of analysis of ESTs data they can use for future datasets.
3. For the protein sequences to be named in a human-readable formatting
4. To be able to retrieve a specific protein sequence from the results.
5. To understand the different outputs and how to use them.


So need to:
1. Download the raw ESTs data.
2. Use Transdecoder to generate the CDS (coding protein sequences)
3. Write a script to rename the sequences
4. Write a script to retrieve sequences from a fasta file based on a ID number.
5. Write a pipeline & manual to help the team repeat the analyses on a different dataset
6. Write a report that explains the findings.
