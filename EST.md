mRNA (messenger RNA) messenger RNA, it consists of a coding region (CDS) , an upstream 5'-non-coding region and a downstream 3'-non-coding region.   
The 5'-end of eukaryotic mRNA has a 7-methylguanosine cap structure and a polyadenylate tail at the 3'-end.    
However, the NCBI mRNA sequence is actually a cDNA sequence, that is, a DNA sequence complementary to the RNA sequence after reverse transcription, and generally does not include a 3'-polyadenylate tail. A cDNA sequence is called a *transcript*.    

The position of the first base is the transcription start site (TSS). cDNA is composed of exons, but only one exon, which encodes a protein, is called CDS (coding sequence).   
This sequence is an ORF region, which is the ORF sequence of this cDNA. The upstream sequences of the TSS involved in the transcription of specific genes and their regulation are called promoters.   
For example, prokaryotes have a conserved sequence of TATAAT upstream of the transcription start site -10, contributing to local unwinding, a TTGACA sequence at -35 providing RNA polymerase recognition signals, eukaryotes have upstream -25 to -30 Tata determining the start site, CAAT at at -75 and RNA polymerase, all of which are promoters. The range of promoters is very large and can contain 2,000 bp upstream of the transcription start site.
